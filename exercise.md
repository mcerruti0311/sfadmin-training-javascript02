* Starting with Listing 2.4, remove the onMouseOver and onMouseOut handlers from the <img> element. Instead, add an onClick handler to set the title property of the image to My New Title. (Hint: You can access the image title using this.title.)
* Can you think of an easy way to test whether your script has correctly set the new image title?
